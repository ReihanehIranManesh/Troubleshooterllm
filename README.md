# Troubleshooterllm

Independent project: This project leverages RAG and GPT-3.5 to interpret a range of kitchen appliance manuals (such as refrigerators, microwaves, etc.), featuring an interactive backend that enables users to request specific information from these manuals for device troubleshooting. Enhanced with Google search, the tool recommends pertinent YouTube videos, websites, and images to assist in the troubleshooting process.
